# 👋 Hi, I'm Arsham — Engineer, Builder, Lifelong Learner

I'm a **Mechanical Engineer** turned **Self-Taught Electrical Technician** and now a **Passionate Software Developer**. My journey began with a fascination for robots and mechatronics, which led me to learn electrical engineering on my own, run an electronics repair shop, and work on complex industrial systems like PLCs and VFDs.

Over the past year, I've dived deep into the world of **software development**, where I'm now building full-stack applications, training machine learning models, and even making Telegram bots.
